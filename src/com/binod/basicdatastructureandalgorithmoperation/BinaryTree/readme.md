Binary Tree Structure:

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root.
Nodes with no children are called leaves or terminal nodes.
Traversal:
Binary trees can be traversed in different ways: inorder, preorder, and postorder. Each traversal method defines a specific order in which nodes are visited.

Height of a Binary Tree:
The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. It is the number of edges on the longest downward path from the root to a leaf.

Balanced Binary Tree:
A binary tree is considered balanced if the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by no more than 1. Balanced trees help maintain efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

Binary Search Tree (BST):
A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree that satisfies the binary search property.
In a BST, for each node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than or equal to the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

Complete Binary Tree:
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

Full Binary Tree:
A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

Perfect Binary Tree:
A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level.
