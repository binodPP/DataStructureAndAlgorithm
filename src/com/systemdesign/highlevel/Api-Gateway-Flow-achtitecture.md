1. Client Request: The flow begins with a client sending a request to access an API. 
   This request could be an HTTP request, a WebSocket connection, or any other supported 
   protocol.

2. API Gateway: Upon receiving the request, the API gateway processes it based on 
   configured rules and policies. This includes routing the request to the appropriate 
   backend service, enforcing security measures, and applying rate limiting.

3. Authentication: If authentication is required, the API gateway forwards the request 
   to the authentication service. The authentication service verifies the client's 
   identity using credentials provided in the request (such as API keys, JWT tokens, 
   or OAuth tokens).

4. Authorization: After successful authentication, the API gateway forwards the request 
   to the authorization service. The authorization service determines whether the 
   authenticated client has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. 
   If authorized, the request proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it may be rejected 
   with an authorization error.

5. Rate Limiting: Before forwarding the request to the backend service, the API gateway 
   checks whether the client has exceeded any rate limits. If the request rate exceeds 
   the configured limits, the API gateway may reject the request or throttle it to 
   prevent abuse.

6. Circuit Breaker: The API gateway forwards the request to the backend service, 
   but before doing so, it may pass through a circuit breaker service. The circuit 
   breaker monitors the health of the backend service and may open the circuit 
   (temporarily block requests) if the backend service is experiencing errors or 
   failures. This prevents further requests from reaching the backend service, 
   helping to avoid cascading failures.

7. Backend Service: Once all checks and validations are passed, the API gateway 
   forwards the request to the appropriate backend service for processing. This 
   could be a microservice, a legacy system, or any other component responsible 
   for handling the requested operation.

8. Analytics Data Collection: As the request flows through the system, various 
   components collect data related to API usage, performance metrics, and user 
   behavior. This data is aggregated and analyzed by the analytics service to 
   provide insights into system usage and performance.

9. Logging Monitoring: Throughout the entire process, logs are generated by different 
   components, including the API gateway, backend services, authentication, 
   authorization, and rate limiting services. These logs are monitored in real-time 
   by the logging monitoring service to identify any anomalies, errors, or security 
   incidents that require attention.
